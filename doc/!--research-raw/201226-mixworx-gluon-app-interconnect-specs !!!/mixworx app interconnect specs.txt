mixworx app interconnect specs
=======================================

a) I have pure JavaFX GluonMobile application built using Susbtrate/GraalVM
b) this application defines some easy "text based protocol" for calling/using platform specific service
   (NOT needed to embed this app specific protocol as ATTACH-service implemented as REUSABLE THING in library,
    its simply HIGH LEVEL THING, where for example configuration of platform-specific device will be done
    for ONLY ONE application in platform(android,ios) project built regulary using AndroidStudio/XamarinStudio, XCode)
c) I need some kind of "interprocess" communication (is this TCPIP? localhost Sockets? for example)
   between GluonMobile app and ANOTHER APP/(always-on/launched service, in fact) built DIFFERENTLY as another process...
d) I need to be able to send/queue COMMANDS to the service
e) I need to be able to receive MESSAGES and/or ERRORS from the service, probably even ASYNC-queued too
   (so, also messages initiated by service, catched and queued by GluonMobile thing)
f) Is THIS "HIGHER-LEVEL localhost socket message-queuing thing" candidate to be implemented as general ATTACH-service?
   (so transparent between DESKTOP/ANDROID/IOS too?? usefull? for me it sounds so...)

WHAT YOU MEAN ABOUT THAT?



Some closest examples found on the web:
SQLITE as attach-service or at least portable example on desktop/mobile (BUT ITS OLD)

Some kind of JavaFX sockets implementation ??
