transpile java-like written core to NEW VIRTUAL MULTICORE PROCESSOR ENGINE
============================================================================

-- define VIRTUAL MULTICORE simple instructions processor to be interpretable even 8bit MCUs (ARDUINO C++)
-- as simplest/fast as possible to provide 16bit INTEGER MATH/LOGIC, FLOW CONTROL, V-MEMORY, V-IO
-- PLA/microcode processing based on orthogonal ISA
-- configurable register/vars/context area size, transparently multicore operation, basic sync/pio
-- run any paralel tasks only on virtual cores (# of cores defined by target MCU/CPU posibilities only)
-- functions based async/await operation against virtual cores
-- tiny! tiny! tiny! - portable to EVERYWHERE !!! (at first, everywhere through ARDUINO !!!)
-- replace any micropython/tinygo finally ... with code based in JAVA-like language coded in IntelliJ IDEA !!!


WELL - BIG QUESTION
===================

A) RISC-V INSPIRED  = register based risc

B) PYTHON INSPIRED  = stack based vm
