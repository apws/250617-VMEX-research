; Assumptions:
;   - R16 to R19 are used as general-purpose registers
;   - Z register (R30 and R31) is used for indirect addressing
;   - core.pc is stored in R20 and R21 (16-bit value)
;   - core.prog is stored in R22 and R23 (16-bit base address)

; Load core.prog + core.pc into the Z register
add r30, r20
adc r31, r21

; Load opcode from Z into R16
ld r16, Z

; Right shift R16 by 4 bits
swap r16
andi r16, 0x0F

; Branch based on the value in R16
; Note: You will need to adjust the branch offsets (k) accordingly
brbs 0, R3_TYPE
brbs 1, R2_TYPE
; (continue for the other cases)

; R3_TYPE, R2_TYPE, RC_TYPE, RD_TYPE

; Code for these cases
