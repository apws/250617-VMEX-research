I originally considered SW UART, but this might be finally FAR HARDER AND LARGER

If MCU supports UART HW, then we will code its support layer using SDK tools
to implement uniform access to GPIO + HW UART

OR

we can simply implement ONLY HW UART as MANDATORY .......

BECASE ... we originally thought that GPIO will be mandatory for SW UART !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


We CANT flash totally unknown parts, there MUST be declared support for the chip
having implemented at least HW UART layer to start communication with MCU HW (so ALSO GPIO)

And then we can implement GPIO for that part in ASLIX on VMEX tooo !!!!!!!!!!!!

May be THIS approach will be easiest ??????????????


BUT we need to have working GPIO ASAP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


this is really matter of what will be SIMPLER/SHORTER in code !!!
