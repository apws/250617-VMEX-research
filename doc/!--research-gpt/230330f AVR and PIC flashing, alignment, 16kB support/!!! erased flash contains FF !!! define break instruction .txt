will be needed to edit flash by:

  a) erasing entire MCU memory
  b) editing/entering code/data into flash
      a) manually by W edits, A asm
      b) loading from terminal as M list (W prefixed)
      c) listing of memory by M (copy/paste on terminal)
      d) listing of memory by D (copy/paste on terminal)
      e) ERASING entire memory
      f) re-entering already stored CODE by "pasting to terminal"
         (eighter as binary data "MW" or by new "A" paste


  This way will be possible to use terminal/clipboard as temporary storage...
  (without need of large (nonexisting) RAM buffers on device ...)
